# Stock Price Prediction Objectives

This section describes the overall goals and objectives of the stock price prediction model. It may include information about the purpose of the model, the data it aims to predict, and the intended outcomes.

---

# Dataset

This section provides details about the dataset used for training and validating the model.

---

## Data Structure

This part of the code provides information about the structure of the data. It includes loading the dataset and organizing it. This may involve details about data preprocessing steps.

---

# Model Building

This part of the code involves importing necessary libraries, loading the dataset, and preparing the data for training the LSTM model.

---

# LSTM Model Architecture

This section defines the architecture of the LSTM model. It specifies the number of LSTM units, layers, and the type of activation functions used.

---

# Model Compilation and Training

Here, the model is compiled using a specified loss function and optimizer. It is then trained on the training data for a certain number of epochs and batch size.

---

# Data Preparation for Prediction

The code prepares the input data for making predictions on unseen or validation data. It involves scaling the data and reshaping it to fit the model input shape.

---

# Model Prediction and Inverse Scaling

The trained model is used to predict the stock prices on the validation data. The predictions are then inverse-transformed to get the actual stock prices.

---

# Saving the Model

The trained LSTM model is saved to a file for future use.

---

# Visualization

The code includes plotting of the training data's closing prices and the predicted closing prices on the validation data.

---

# Saving Predictions

The predictions on the validation data are saved as a new column in the DataFrame containing the validation data.
